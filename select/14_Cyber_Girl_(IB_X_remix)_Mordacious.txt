Cyber girl
Cyber girl
Cyber girl
Cyber girl

I see you
Standing over there
With your pale white skin
And your long black hair
Stomping your way
To the dance floor
Throwing out your arms
And crying for more

You are the girl everyone adores
Snap your fingers
They'll be crawling on the floor
Kissing your boots and begging for more
Wearing almost nothing
You're what they came for

Cyber girl
Cyber girl
Cyber girl
Cyber girl

You're my cyber girl
You're my cyber girl
You're my cyber girl
You're my cyber girl

Cyber girl, I think I love you

I see you
Standing over there
With your pale white skin
And your long black hair
Stomping your way
To the dance floor
Throwing out your arms
And crying for more

You are the girl everyone adores
Snap your fingers
They'll be crawling on the floor
Kissing your boots and begging for more
Wearing almost nothing
You're what they came for

That sexy walk, those eyes
Your evil look makes me die
I want to know your name
I want to know your game
